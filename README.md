# Python Ant Colony Algorithm Applied To Traveling Salesman Problem 

This small project aims to reproduce the ant colony optimization algorithm to solve the traveling salesman problem. 
This problem consists in finding the best path (tour with the minimum  total length) for the travelling salesman, where he passes by all the cities once.

This project was inspired from : https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/0-306-48056-5_9 

## Description

This project is built in Python and consist of three files :

* data.py, contains two graphes examples (you can add your own).
* functions.py, which have the essential functions used in the ACO algorithm.
* aco.py, the main file which contains the ACO global parameters.


### Dependencies

* Python 3


### Executing program
* You can change the graph or the global parameters in the file (aco.py) first.
* Simply run aco.py

```
python aco.py

```
